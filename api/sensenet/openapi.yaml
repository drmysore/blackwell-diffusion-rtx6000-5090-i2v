      # Overview

      The Posts system manages content that lives natively on fleek, providing community features like feeds, engagement tracking, and discovery mechanisms. Posts are the base content created within the platform that can later be shared to social media platforms.

      <h2 style="margin-top:1em">Post Management</h2>

      - **Creating Posts**: Posts require a caption and can include multiple content assets (images, videos)
      - **Post Lifecycle**: Posts can be drafts, scheduled, published, or failed
      - **Engagement**: Users can like posts and view engagement metrics
      - **Profile Association**: Each post belongs to a specific profile

      <h2 style="margin-top:1em">Relationship to Social Sharing</h2>

      - **Content Creation**: Posts are created first within the fleek platform
      - **Social Distribution**: Posts can then be shared across multiple social media platforms
      - **Unified Management**: Posts serve as the central content hub before distribution

      The Posts API provides the core content management and community experience for the fleek platform.

    description: "## Overview\nContent Studio operates through **content sessions** - persistent workspaces that maintain context and enable iterative content creation. Each session is associated with a profile and serves as the foundation for generating related content.\n\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:1em\">Content Sessions</h2>\n\nEach session maintains its identity throughout its lifecycle, allowing for coherent content creation that builds upon previous outputs or resets to start fresh when needed.\n\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:1em\">Content Messages</h2>\n\nWithin each session, **content messages** represent individual generation requests. Each message:\n\n- Contains a text prompt describing the desired content\n- Triggers asynchronous content generation \n- Tracks generation status (generating → ready/failed/archived)\n- Can build upon previous session context or reset to base sources via `resetContext: true`\n- Produces one or more content assets upon completion\n\n<h2 style=\"margin-top:1em\">Content Assets</h2>\n\n**Content assets** are the final generated outputs - images, videos, or other media files. Each asset:\n\n- Belongs to a specific message and session\n- Includes metadata (dimensions, content type, NSFW status)\n- Provides direct CDN URLs for immediate use\n- Maintains relationships to its source message and session context\n\nThe API follows a create → poll → retrieve pattern: create messages for async generation, poll message status for completion, then retrieve the resulting content assets.\n"
